# IMPORTANT NOTICE

```
1 - YOU NEED TO CREATE A .ENV FILE (SEE EXAMPLE FILE .example-env)


2 - YOU WILL NEED TO ADD A KEY CALLED PRIVATE_KEYS
PRIVATE_KEYS MUST BE THE PRIVATE KEY OF A WALLET ADDRESS THAT YOU WISH TO BE THE OWNER OF YOUR CONTRACT ONCE DEPLOYED
YOU WILL NEED TO PROVIDE YOUR ACCOUNT WITH SOME TEST CURRENCY IN ORDER TO DEPLOY TO A TESTNET

2 - YOU WILL ALSO NEED TO ADD A KEY CALLED INFURA_ID TO YOUR .ENV
INFURA_ID MUST BE A VALID INFURA PROJECT_ID , WITHOUT THIS YOUR MIGRATION WONT WORK AS IT WONT BE POINTING TO A VALID ETHEREUM NODE

3 - YOUR ABI FILE WILL NOT EXIST UNTIL YOU RUN UNTIL YOU RUN TRUFFLE MIGRATE
